#' @title Data set showing simple and moderated mediation analysis
#'
#' @description A data set containing data from Experiment 3 from Ho, Kteiley,
#'   and Chen (2017). In this experiment, the authors hypothesized that
#'   presenting a text stating that Black-White biracials were discriminated
#'   against would lead Black participants to associate Black-White biracials
#'   more with their lower status parent group than their higher status parent
#'   group, according to the rule of *hypodescent*. In this experiment, the
#'   authors tested if this effect was mediated by the sense of linked fate
#'   between discriminated Black-White biracials and Black participants.
#'
#'   Note that this data set does not include the participants who were in the
#'   discrimination control condition in the study conducted by Ho, Kteiley and
#'   Chen (2017).
