#' @title Data set showing simple and moderated mediation analysis
#'
#' @description A data set containing data from Experiment 3 from Ho, Kteiley,
#'   and Chen (2017). In this experiment, authors hypothised that presenting a
#'   text stating that Black-White biracials were discriminated would lead Black
#'   participants to associate Black-White biracials more with their lower
#'   status parent group than their higher status parent group, according to the
#'   rule of \emph{hypodescent}. In this experiment, the authors tested if this
#'   effect was mediated by the sense of linked fate between discriminated
#'   Black-White participants and Black participants.
#'
#'   Note that this data set does not include participants who were in the
#'   discrimination control condition in the study conducted by Ho, Kteiley and
#'   Chen (2017).

#'   simple mediation or a moderated mediation analysis with this dataset.
