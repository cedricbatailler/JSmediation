This vignette reports a moderated mediation analysis. This will help getting
familiar with the several helpers *JSmediation* offers to conduct moderated
mediation analysis.

## Overview

Simple mediation refers to the pattern of statistical relationships in which the
effect of a variable on another goes through a third variable. Sometimes, this
indirect relationship is conditional to a fourth variable—a moderator. In such
a case, we talk about **moderated mediation**. The *JSmediation* package
offers a collection of tools to conduct and report a moderated mediation analysis
[@muller_when_2005].

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
library(JSmediation)
library(dplyr)
```

The [Introduction to JSmediation](jsmediation.html) vignette uses a data set
collected by Ho et al. [-@ho_youre_2017] to illustrate simple mediation. This
data set contains the result of an experiment in which Ho et al. focus on
hypodescent among Black Americans. To illustrate how *JSmediation* can be used
to conduct a moderated mediation analysis, we will expand on this example.

Hypodescent  refers to a rule observed in multiracial categorization. Research
shows that majority group social perceivers (i.e., White Americans) typically
associate Black-White multiracials with their lower status group rather than
with their higher group (i.e., with Black Americans rather than with White
Americans). This phenomenon is called the hypodescent rule and it was retrieved
in the Black Americans population by Ho et al. [-@ho_youre_2017]. The hypothesis
is that such categorization occurs because of a sentiment of linked fate
between Black Americans and Black-White multiracials.

This observation was supported by data showing that Black Americans felt a
stronger sentiment of linked fate between them and Black-White multiracials when
they read about an article discussing how Black-White multiracials were likely
to suffer from discrimination (compared to an article discussing how they were
not). The higher sentiment of linked fate was associated with a higher use of
the hypodescent rule in multiracial categorization. In other words, the effect
of a discrimination condition on hypodescent rule was mediated by the feeling of
linked fate.

In the current vignette, we will investigate whether this indirect effect is
moderated by social dominance orientation (SDO). Indeed, SDO correlates with
preferences for intergroup equality—higher levels indicates resistance to
intergroup equality and support for maintaining status quo, lower levels
indicates support for intergroup equality and reducing hierarchy
[@ho_youre_2017]. Ho et al. [-@ho_youre_2017] assumed that the indirect effect
will be stronger for Black Americans showing lower levels of SDO. They should
feel a higher sentiment of linked fate when presented information related to
the high discrimination of Black-White multiracials.

```{r}
data(ho_et_al)
```

Note that this vignette was written to illustrate features from the
*JSmediation* package. We will use functions from other packages (e.g.,
`dplyr`), but make it explicit when we do so. In other words, if you want to
reproduce this example, you do not have to type `dplyr::mutate`, `mutate` will
suffice.

## Formatting the data set

The data set collected by Ho et al. [-@ho_youre_2017]  contains the information
necessary for the test of our hypothesis of moderated mediation. It contains a
`condition` column indicating whether participants were read about the high or
low discrimination of Black-White multiracials and a `hypodescent` column. The
data set also contains a `linkedfate` column indicating the feeling of linked
fate participants felt in the experimental situation. The simple mediation
analysis in the [Introduction to JSmediation](jsmediation.html) vignette shows
that participants in high discrimination conditions tend to feel a higher level
of linked fate which results in higher hypodescent. We will now investigate
whether this indirect effect is more likely to be observed among participants
who show higher levels of SDO (thanks to the `sdo` column).

```{r}
head(ho_et_al)
```

Before we run the moderated mediation analysis, we must tweak the data set a
little bit. Muller et al. [-@muller_when_2005] recommend centering the
continuous predictors and contrast-coding the categorical ones. *JSmediation*
offers helpers like `build_contrast` or `standardize_variables` to do so.

```{r}
ho_et_al <-
  ho_et_al %>%
  standardize_variables(c(sdo, linkedfate), suffix = "c") %>%
  dplyr::mutate(condition_c = build_contrast(condition,
                                             "Low discrimination",
                                             "High discrimination")
  )

head(ho_et_al)
```

The first function we used, `standardize_variables`, allows us to center and
reduce (to standardize) a set of variables (here: `sdo` and `linkedfate`). The
`suffix` argument of this function is used to name the standardized variables.
Here, because we set `suffix = "c"`, the new variables are named `sdo_c` and
`linkedfate_c`. When the suffix argument is blank, original variables are
overwritten. Because *JSmediation* was designed to fit within the tidyverse,
`standardize_variables` is especially useful in a *dplyr*
[chain](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/dplyr.html#combining-functions-with-
"Combining functions with `%>%`").

Here, we also used a second function from *JSmediation*: `build_contrast`. This
function takes a character vector as a first argument and, then, returns a
contrast-coded variables. It is designed for variables with two conditions,
which is the case of `condition`. Because we want to include the transformed
variable in `ho_et_al`, we can use the `dplyr::mutate` function which [create
(or modify) variables](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html
"Create, modify, and delete columns"). With this method, we contrast-coded the
`condition` variable.

```{r}
ho_et_al %>% 
  dplyr::select(dplyr::starts_with("condition"))
```

## Fitting the moderated mediation model

We will now run our moderated mediation analysis. Remember, we are testing
whether participants in high discrimination condition show higher level of
hypodescent because of a higher perception of linked fate, and whether this
indirect effect is higher among people with high level of SDO. In other words,
we are testing whether SDO moderates the mediation of the effect on condition on
hypodescent through linked fate perception. To test this moderated mediation, we
will use the `mdt_moderated` function.

### Testing moderated mediation

Muller et al. [-@muller_when_2005] provide an accessible introduction on how to
conduct a moderated mediation analysis using the joint-significance methods. In
a nutshell, one will fit several linear models to the data set, and, depending
on the significance of some coefficients, one will be able to assess moderated
mediation.

To better understand the process of testing a moderated mediation, we can glance
at the equation describing the moderation of the indirect effect of X on Y. Such
moderation can be described as follows:

$$
c \times Mod = c' \times Mod + (a \times Mod) \times b + a \times (b \times Mod)
$$

with $c \times Mod$ the total moderation of the indirect effect, $c' \times Mod$
the moderation of the direct effect, $(a \times Mod) \times b$, the moderation
of the indirect effect passing by the moderation of $a$, and $a \times (b \times
Mod)$, the moderation of the indirect effect passing by the moderation of $b$
(see Models section; Muller et al., 2005).

Either both $a \times Mod$ and $b$ or both $a$ and $b \times Mod$ need to be
simultaneously significant for the moderation of the indirect effect to be claimed
(Muller et al., 2005).

### Running the analysis with JSmediation

`mdt_moderated` works like every `mdt_*` function. It will be fit the necessary
linear models (see the Models section in the help page of `mdt_moderated`) and
returns the relevant coefficient in a nicely formatted output.

To use the function, we will have to describe the role of the variable in the
`ho_et_al` data set.

```{r}
moderated_mediation_fit <- 
  mdt_moderated(data = ho_et_al,
                IV   = condition_c,
                DV   = hypodescent, 
                M    = linkedfate_c,
                Mod  = sdo_c)
```

Most of the math occurs when `mdt_moderated` is evaluated. The
`moderated_mediation_fit` that we just computed contains every linear model
useful to assess moderated mediation, as described in Muller et al.
[-@muller_when_2005].

As we can see, it is possible to see $a$, $a \times Mod$, $b$, and $b \times
Mod$ in the `mdt_moderated` output.

```{r}
moderated_mediation_fit
```

If a moderated mediation model is significant, Yzerbyt et al.
[-@yzerbyt_new_2018] recommend reporting the moderated mediation index. To
compute this index, *JSmediation* offers the  `add_index`method. In the case of
moderated mediation, we will have to specify whether we are in a scenario where
we assume that the moderator impacts the relation between or IV and the mediator
(i.e., both $a \times Mod$ and $b$ are significant), the relation between the
moderator and the DV (i.e., both $a$ and $b \times Mod$ are significant), or
both. To do so, we must use the `stage` argument.

```{r}
moderated_mediation_fit_w_index <- moderated_mediation_fit %>%
  add_index(stage = "first")
```

The output of the new object now contains the index.

```{r}
moderated_mediation_fit_w_index
```

### Reporting moderated mediation

The `moderated_mediation_fit_w_index` object that we computed contains every bit
of information to report a moderated mediation in an analysis, following Yzerbyt
et al.'s [-@yzerbyt_new_2018] recommendations:

> To assess whether SDO moderates the indirect effect of discrimination
condition on hypodescent through linked fate perception, we conducted a
moderated mediation analysis [@muller_when_2005]. This analysis first revealed
that SDO moderates the effect of condition on linked fate perception, *t*(820) =
4.25, *p* \< .001. It also revealed that the effect of linked fate perception
for a mean level of SDO, and controlling for the effect of the condition and for
the moderation of the condition by SDO, predicted significantly hypodescent,
*t*(818) = 3.75, *p* \< .001. This pattern reveals the existence of a moderated
mediation. We also computed the first stage moderated mediation index consistent
with our joint-significant analysis and it confirmed the moderated mediation,
-0.0432, $CI_{95\%}$ [-0.0778; -0.0171] (Monte Carlo simulation, 5000
simulations; Yzerbyt et al., 2018).

## Mediation analysis for a moderator's value

When reporting a moderated mediation analysis, it is sometimes useful to know
what the indirect effect is for several values of the moderator. The
`compute_indirect_effect_for` function serves that purpose.

`compute_indirect_effect_for` takes as the first argument a moderated mediation
model for which we want to compute the indirect effect at a specific value of
the moderator and as the second argument the value of the moderator.

In our example, we standardized our moderator. A mean value of the moderator
therefore is `sdo_c = 0`. If we wanted to compute the effect of condition on
hypodescent through linked fate for a mean value of SDO, we would have to run
the following:

```{r}
compute_indirect_effect_for(moderated_mediation_fit, Mod = 0)
```

We could also compute this indirect effect for participants who score one
standard deviation above the mean in terms of SDO.

```{r}
compute_indirect_effect_for(moderated_mediation_fit, Mod = 1)
```

As we can see, the indirect effect estimate decreases when the SDO increases.
This result is consistent with the negative value of the moderated mediation
index.
