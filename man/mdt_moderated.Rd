\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the variables in the model.}

independant variable.}

\item{DV}{An unquoted variable in the data frame which will be used as
dependant variable.}

mediator.}

}
\value{
Returns an object of class "\code{mediation_model}" object.

An object of class "\code{mediation_model}" is a least containing at list
the components:

\item{type}{A character string containing the type of model that has been
conducted (e.g., \code{"simple mediation"}).}
\item{method}{A character string containing the approach that has been
used to conduct the mediation analysis (usually
\code{"joint significance"}).}
\item{params}{A named list of character strings describing variables used
in the model.}
\item{paths}{A named list containing information on each relevent path of
the mediation model.}
\item{indirect_index}{A boolean indicating wether indirect effect index has
been computed. Defaults to \code{FALSE}. See \code{\link{add_index}} to
compute mediation index.}
\item{indirect_index_infos}{(Optional) An object of class
\code{"indirect_index"}. Appears when one apply \code{\link{add_index}}
to an object of class \code{"mediation_model"}.}
\item{js_models}{A list of objects of class \code{"lm"}. Contains every
model used in joint-significance test.}
\item{data}{The original data frame that has been been passed through
\code{data} argument.}
}
\description{
Given a data frame, a predictor (\code{IV}), an outcome
(\code{DV}), a mediator (\code{M}), and a moderator (\code{Mod}) conducts a
joint-significant test for moderated mediation (see Yzerbyt, Muller,
Batailler, & Judd, 2018).
}
\details{
With moderated mediation analysis, one is intrested in finding if an
indirect effect of \eqn{X} on \eqn{Y} through \eqn{M} is moderated by
\eqn{Mod}. The hypothesis behind this test is that \eqn{X} has an effect on
\eqn{M} (\eqn{a}) which has an effect on \eqn{Y} (\eqn{b}), meaning that
\eqn{X} has an indrect effect on \eqn{Y} through \eqn{M}.

Total moderation of the indirect effect of \eqn{X} on \eqn{Y} can be
described the following way:

\eqn{c * Mod = c' * Mod + (a * Mod) * b + a * (b * Mod)}

with \eqn{c * Mod} the total moderation of the indirect effect, \eqn{c' *
  Mod} the moderation of the direct effect, \eqn{(a * Mod) * b}, the
moderation of the indirect effect passing by the moderation of \eqn{a}, and
\eqn{a * (b * Mod)}, the moderation of the indirect effect passing by the
moderation of \eqn{b} (see Models section; Muller et al., 2005).

To assess if the moderation of the indirect effect is different from the
null, one has either to assess the significance against the null for both
\eqn{a * Mod} and \eqn{b} or \eqn{a} and \eqn{b * Mod}.

Both \eqn{a * Mod} and \eqn{b} or \eqn{a} and \eqn{b * Mod} needs to be
simultaneously significant for a moderation of the indirect effect to be
claimed (Muller et al., 2005).
}
\section{Models}{
 In a moderated mediation model, three models will be used:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{Y_i = b_{40} + \mathbf{b_{41}} X_i + b_{42} Mo_i + \mathbf{b_{43}}
  XMo_i }{Yi = b_41 + b41*Xi + b42*Moi + + b43*XMoi}
\item \eqn{M_i = b_{50} + \mathbf{b_{51}} X_i + b_{52} Mo_i + \mathbf{b_{53}
  XMo_i}}{Mi = b_50 + b_51*Xi + b_52 Moi + b53 XMoi}
\item \eqn{Y_i = b_{60} + \mathbf{c'_{61}} X_i + b_{62} Mo_i + \mathbf{b_{63}
  Xmo_i} + \mathbf{b_{64} Me_i} + \mathbf{b_{65} MeMo_i}}{Yi = b_60 + b61*Xi
  + b_62*Moi + b63 XMoi + b64 Mei + b65 MeMoi}
}

with \eqn{Y_i}{Yi}, outcome value for the \emph{i}th observation,
\eqn{X_i}{Xi}, predictor value for the \emph{i}th observation,
\eqn{Mo_i}{Xi}, moderatir value for the \emph{i}th observation, and
\eqn{M_i}{Mi}, mediator value for the \emph{i}th observation.

Coefficients associated with \eqn{a}, \eqn{a \times Mod}{a * Mod}, \eqn{b},
\eqn{b \times Mod}{b * Mod}, \eqn{c}, \eqn{c \times Mod}{c * Mod},
\eqn{c'}, and \eqn{c' \times Mod}{c' * Mod}, paths are respectively
\eqn{b_{51}}{b_51}, \eqn{b_{53}}{b_53}, \eqn{b_{64}}{b_64},
\eqn{b_{65}}{b_65}, \eqn{b_{41}}{b_41}, \eqn{b_{43}}{b_43},
\eqn{b_{61}}{b_61}, and \eqn{b_{63}}{c63} (see Muller et al., 2005).
}

\section{Variable coding}{
 Because joint-significance tests uses linear models
uneder the scene, variables involved in the model have to be numeric.
\code{mdt_simple} will throw an error if non-numeric variables are
specified in the model.

If you need to convert a dichotomous categorical variable to a numeric one,
please refer to \code{\link{build_contrast}} function.

Note that variable coding is especially important in models with multiple
predictors as it is the cas in the model used to conduct a
joint-significance test of moderated mediation. Muller et al. (2005)
recommend using variable wich are either contrast-coded or centered. Using
\code{mdt_moderated} with a DV, a mediator, or a moderator which is neither
will warn you.
