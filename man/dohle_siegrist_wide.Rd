\description{
A data set containing data from Dohle and Siegrist (2014)'s
Experiment 1 that can be used to conduct within-subject joint-significance
test. In this experiment, authors are intrested in the effect of name
complexity on willingness to buy a drug. The specific hypothesis would be
that complex drug name would be percieved as more hazardous, which would in
turn make someone less likely to buy the drug. Because in real life, one
have to choose between several drugs, this experiment where name complexity
was manipulated and where hazardousness and willingness to buy were measured
was conducted in a within-subject design.

This data set is in a wide format, see \code{\link{mdt_within_wide}} to
conduct a within-participant mediation analysis with this dataset.
