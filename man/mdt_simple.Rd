\title{Joint-significance test for simple mediation}
\usage{
mdt_simple(data, IV, DV, M)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the variables to be used in the model.}

\item{IV}{An unquoted numeric variable in the data frame which will be used
as independant variable.}

\item{DV}{An unquoted numeric variable in the data frame which will be used
as dependant variable.}

\item{M}{An unquoted numeric variable in the data frame which will be used as
mediator.}
}
\value{
Returns an object of class "\code{mediation_model}" object.

An object of class "\code{mediation_model}" is a least containing at list
the components:

\item{type}{A character string containing the type of model that has been
conducted (e.g., \code{"simple mediation"}).}
\item{method}{A character string containing the approach that has been
used to conduct the mediation analysis (usually
\code{"joint significance"}).}
\item{params}{A named list of character strings describing variables used
in the model.}
\item{paths}{A named list containing information on each relevent path of
the mediation model.}
\item{indirect_index}{A boolean indicating wether indirect effect index has
been computed. Defaults to \code{FALSE}. See \code{\link{add_index}} to
compute mediation index.}
\item{indirect_index_infos}{(Optional) An object of class
\code{"indirect_index"}. Appears when one apply \code{\link{add_index}}
to an object of class \code{"mediation_model"}.}
\item{js_models}{A list of objects of class \code{"lm"}. Contains every
model used in joint-significance test.}
\item{data}{The original data frame that has been been passed through
\code{data} argument.}
}
\description{
Given a data frame, a predictor (\code{IV}), an outcome
(\code{DV}), and a mediator (\code{M}), conducts a joint-significant test
for simple mediation (see Yzerbyt, Muller, Batailler, & Judd, 2018).
}
\details{
With simple mediation analysis, one is intrested in finding if the
effect of \eqn{X} on \eqn{Y} goes through a third variable \eqn{M}. The
hypothesis behind this test is that \eqn{X} has an effect on \eqn{M}
(\eqn{a}) which has an effect on \eqn{Y} (\eqn{b}), meaning that \eqn{X}
has an indrect effect on \eqn{Y} through \eqn{M}.

Total effect of \eqn{X} on \eqn{Y} can be described the following way:

\deqn{c = c' + ab}

with \eqn{c} the total effect of \eqn{X} on \eqn{Y}, \eqn{c'} the direct of
\eqn{X} on \eqn{Y}, and \eqn{ab} the indirect effect of \eqn{X} on \eqn{Y}
through {M} (see Models section).

To assess if the indirect effect is different from the null, one has to
assess the significance against the null for both \eqn{a} (the effect of
\eqn{X} on \eqn{M}) for and \eqn{b} (effect of \eqn{M} on \eqn{Y}
controlling for the effect of \eqn{X}). Both \eqn{a} and \eqn{b} needs to
be simultaneously significant for an indirect effect to be claimed (Baron &
Kenny, 1986; Judd & Kenny, 1981).
}
\section{Models}{
 In a simple mediation model, three models will be used:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{Y_i = b_{10} + \mathbf{c_{11}} X_i}{Yi = b_10 + c_11*Xi}
\item \eqn{M_i = b_{20} + \mathbf{a_{21}} X_i}{Mi = b_20 + a_21*Xi}
\item \eqn{Y_i = b_{30} + \mathbf{c'_{31}} X_i + \mathbf{b_{32}} M_i}{Yi =
    b_30 + c'_31*Xi + b_32*Mi}
}

with \eqn{Y_i}{Yi}, outcome value for the \emph{i}th observation,
\eqn{X_i}{Xi}, predictor value for the \emph{i}th observation, and
\eqn{M_i}{Mi}, mediator value for the \emph{i}th observation (Baron &
Kenny, 1986; Judd & Kenny, 1981).

Coefficients associated with \eqn{a}, \eqn{aMod} \eqn{b}, \eqn{c}, and
\eqn{c'} paths are respectively \eqn{a_{21}}{a_21}, \eqn{b_{32}}{b_32},
\eqn{c_{11}}{c_11}, and \eqn{c'_{31}}{c'_31}.
}

\section{Variable coding}{
 Because joint-significance tests uses linear models
uneder the scene, variables involved in the model have to be numeric.
\code{mdt_simple} will throw an error if non-numeric variables are
specified in the model.

If you need to convert a dichotomous categorical variable to a numeric one,
please refer to \code{\link{build_contrast}} function.
}

\examples{
## fit a simple mediation model
data(ho_et_al)
ho_et_al$condition_c <- build_contrast(ho_et_al$condition,
                                       "Low discrimination",
                                       "High discrimination")
mdt_simple(data = ho_et_al,
           IV = condition_c,
           DV = hypodescent,
           M = linkedfate)
