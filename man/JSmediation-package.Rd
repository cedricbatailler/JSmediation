\description{
A set of helper functions to conduct joint-significance test for
mediation analysis.
}
\details{
The main functions of the \pkg{JSmediation} package follow an
\code{mdt_*} pattern. \code{mdt_*} family functions and allow you to
conduct joint-significance tests for various mediation models.

The syntax for \code{mdt_*} family functions is usually the same. The first
argument is always a data frame (\code{data})  which is followed by the
variable names involved in the model (e.g., DV, IV). Because \code{mdt_*}
family functions use non-standard evaluation, these variable names must
generaly be specified unquoted.

\code{mdt_*} family functions allow you to create an object of class
\code{"mediation_model"} for which various methods are implemented.

See \code{vignette("jsmediation")} for a general introduction and overview
of \pkg{JSmediation}.
