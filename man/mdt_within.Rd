\value{
Returns an object of class "\code{mediation_model}" object.

An object of class "\code{mediation_model}" is a least containing at list
the components:

\item{type}{A character string containing the type of model that has been
conducted (e.g., \code{"simple mediation"}).}
\item{method}{A character string containing the approach that has been
used to conduct the mediation analysis (usually
\code{"joint significance"}).}
\item{params}{A named list of character strings describing variables used
in the model.}
\item{paths}{A named list containing information on each relevent path of
the mediation model.}
\item{indirect_index}{A boolean indicating wether indirect effect index has
been computed. Defaults to \code{FALSE}. See \code{\link{add_index}} to
compute mediation index.}
\item{indirect_index_infos}{(Optional) An object of class
\code{"indirect_index"}. Appears when one apply \code{\link{add_index}}
to an object of class \code{"mediation_model"}.}

model used in joint-significance test.}
\item{data}{The original data frame that has been been passed through
\code{data} argument.}

\description{
Given a data frame, a predictor (\code{IV}), an outcome
(\code{DV}), a mediator (\code{M}), and a grouping variable (\code{group})
conducts a joint-significant test for within-participant mediation (see
Yzerbyt, Muller, Batailler, & Judd, 2018).
}
\details{
With within-participant mediation analysis, one is intrested in
finding if the effect of \eqn{X} on \eqn{Y} goes through a third variable
\eqn{M}. The particularity of within-participant mediation analysis lies in
the repeated-measure design used. With such design, each sampled unit
(e.g., participant) is measured on the dependent variable \eqn{Y} and the
mediator \eqn{M} in the two conditions of \eqn{X}. The hypothesis behind
this test is that \eqn{X} has an effect on \eqn{M} (\eqn{a}) which has an
effect on \eqn{Y} (\eqn{b}), meaning that \eqn{X} has an indrect effect on
\eqn{Y} through \eqn{M}.

As with simple mediation, total effect of \eqn{X} on \eqn{Y} can be
conceptually described the following way:

\deqn{c = c' + ab}

with \eqn{c} the total effect of \eqn{X} on \eqn{Y}, \eqn{c'} the direct of
\eqn{X} on \eqn{Y}, and \eqn{ab} the indirect effect of \eqn{X} on \eqn{Y}
through {M} (see Models section).

To assess if the indirect effect is different from the null, one has to
assess the significance against the null for both \eqn{a} (the effect of
\eqn{X} on \eqn{M}) for and \eqn{b} (effect of \eqn{M} on \eqn{Y}
controlling for the effect of \eqn{X}). Both \eqn{a} and \eqn{b} needs to
be simultaneously significant for an indirect effect to be claimed (Judd,
Kenny, & McClelland, 2001; Montoya and Hayes, 2011).

\section{Models}{
 For within-participant mediation, three models will be used:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{Y_{2i} - Y_{1i} = c_{11}}{Y2i - Y1i = c11}
\item \eqn{M_{2i} - M_{1i} = a_{21}}{M2i - M1i = a21}
\item \eqn{Y_{2i} - Y_{1i} = c'_{31} + b_{32}(M_{2i} - M_{1i}) +
  d_{33}[0.5(M_{1i} + M_{2i}) - 0.5(\overline{M_{1} + M_{2}})]}{Y2i - Y1i =
  c'31 + b32 * (M2i + M1i) + d33 * [0.5 * (M1i + M2i) - 0.5 * mean(M1 + M2)]}
}

with \eqn{Y_{2i} - Y_{1i}}{Y2i - Y1i} the difference score beetween DV
conditions for the outcome variable for the \emph{i}th observation,
\eqn{M_{2i} - M_{1i}}{M2i - M1i} the difference score between DV conditions
for the mediator variable for the \emph{i}th observation, \eqn{M_{1i} +
  M_{2i}}{M1i + M2i} the sum of mediator variables values for DV conditions
for the \emph{i}th observation, and \eqn{\overline{M_{1} + M_{2}}}{mean(M1i
  + M2i)} the mean sum of mediator variables values for DV conditions across
observations (see Montoya and Hayes, 2011).

Coefficients associated with \eqn{a}, \eqn{b}, \eqn{c}, and \eqn{c'} paths
are respectively \eqn{a_{21}}{a21}, \eqn{b_{32}}{b32}, \eqn{c_{11}}{c11},
and \eqn{c'_{31}}{c'31}.
}

\section{Data formatting}{
 To be consistant with other \code{mdt_*} family
functions, \code{mdt_within} takes a long-format data frame as \code{data}
argument. With this kind of format, each sampled unit has two rows, one for
the first within-participant condition and one for the second
within-participant condition. In addition, each row has one observation for
the outcome and one observation for the mediator (see
\code{\link{dohle_siegrist}} for an example.

Because such formatting is not the most common among social scientists
intrested in within-participant mediation, \pkg{JSmediation} contains the
\code{\link{mdt_within_wide}} function which handles long-formatted data
input (but is syntax-inconsistant with other \code{mdt_*} family
functions).
}

\section{Variable coding}{
 Within-participant mediation model's underlying
models uses difference scores as DV (see Models section). Because the
function input does not allow the user to specify how the difference scores
should be computed, \code{mdt_within} has a default coding.

\code{mdt_within}'s default behavior is to compute a difference score so
the total effect (the effect of \eqn{X} on \eqn{Y}) will be positive and
compute other difference scores accordingly.

User can change choose to have a negative total effect by using the
\code{default_coding} argument.

Note that \code{DV} and \code{M} have to be numeric.
